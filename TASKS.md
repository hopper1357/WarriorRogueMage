This is an excellent idea to delve deeper into the project structure. Elaborating on each step, drawing directly from the Warrior, Rogue & Mage (WR&M) source material, will help ensure the PC game remains faithful to the tabletop experience.
Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how each phase could be structured:
Phase 1: Core System Development & Engine Implementation
This phase would establish the fundamental mechanics and rules of WR&M within the game engine, focusing on its simple, lightweight, and flexible design.
• Game Engine Selection:
    ◦ Detail: The choice of engine is crucial. It should facilitate a flexible and intuitive system. Given the emphasis on players and GMs being able to "make WR&M your own", the engine should ideally support robust modding capabilities. This would allow players to add new lands, create new monsters, change rules, and write their own spells, extending the game's life and creativity beyond its initial release. An engine that allows for easy content creation and rule tweaking would align with the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0 license the original game operates under, which permits free copying and sharing for personal use.
• Attribute and Skill System:
    ◦ Detail: This would be a core programming task.
        ▪ Implement the three basic attributes: Warrior, Rogue, and Mage. These attributes directly measure capabilities in combat, stealth, and academics respectively.
        ▪ Each attribute would be typically ranked from 0 to 6, though veteran characters and monsters can have higher values.
        ▪ Develop the binary skill system: characters either "have learned a skill, or have not".
        ▪ Skills are related to one of the attributes (e.g., Axes, Blunt, Polearms, Riding, Swords, Unarmed for Warrior; Acrobatics, Bows, Daggers, Firearms, Thievery, Thrown for Rogue; Alchemy, Awareness, Herbalism, Lore, Thaumaturgy for Mage).
        ▪ A character cannot choose a skill if the relevant attribute is ranked at level 0. The system must enforce this.
• Core Resolution Mechanics:
    ◦ Attribute Checks:
        ▪ Detail: The system for performing actions would involve rolling one six-sided die (d6) and adding the character's relevant attribute's level.
        ▪ If the character knows an appropriate skill, a +2 bonus would be added to the result.
        ▪ An optional rule allowing an additional +2 for knowing more than one relevant skill could also be implemented, requiring GM (game system) discretion.
        ▪ The final result would be compared to a Difficulty Level (DL) (e.g., Easy 5, Routine 7, Challenging 9, Hard 11, Extreme 13). Success occurs if the result is equal to or higher than the DL.
        ▪ The game would also need to simulate GM decisions to allow automatic success for tasks with extremely low risk or minor importance if the character has an appropriate skill.
    ◦ Exploding Die:
        ▪ Detail: A crucial mechanic: whenever a player rolls a 6 on damage rolls and attribute checks that use an appropriate skill, the die "explodes". The system would add 6 to the total and then roll again, adding the new result. This process repeats for subsequent 6s.
    ◦ Opposed Checks:
        ▪ Detail: For direct competitions between two characters, the system would simulate both characters making a roll for their appropriate attribute (and skill). The higher result wins. The system must allow for different attributes/skills to oppose each other (e.g., a Rogue's Thievery opposing a Guard's Mage/Awareness).
        ▪ An optional, simplified method for PC vs. passive NPC could be implemented, where the DL for the PC's roll is calculated by adding 3 to the NPC's relevant attribute (+2 for skill).
    ◦ Circumstantial Modifiers:
        ▪ Detail: The game engine would need a system to apply circumstantial modifiers to DLs, reflecting factors like lack of tools, master-crafted items, or environmental conditions (e.g., bad lighting for hiding). These modifiers would dynamically adjust the difficulty of actions.
• Character Creation & Progression System:
    ◦ Character Creator:
        ▪ Detail: A comprehensive character creation interface would allow players to distribute 10 attribute levels among Warrior, Rogue, and Mage, with no attribute starting higher than 6.
        ▪ Players would then choose three starting skills (ensuring the relevant attribute is not 0).
        ▪ Finally, players select one talent.
    ◦ Racial Implementation:
        ▪ Detail: The character creator would include options for non-human races (Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Lizardman, Goblin, Orc). Upon selection, the character would automatically receive racial talents and drawbacks, such as an Elf's Exceptional Attribute (Mage) and Sixth Sense, or a Dwarf's Craftsman and No Talent for Magic. The system should be designed to allow for the creation of new custom races as well, aligning with the GM's encouragement to invent new racial talents.
    ◦ Advancement System:
        ▪ Detail: Instead of traditional experience points, the game would use a milestone-based advancement system, where the "GM" (game system) decides when characters are ready to advance, typically after successful adventures.
        ▪ Upon advancement, players could choose to: raise one attribute by one, add 1d6 to either HP or Mana (with an optional fixed +3 points instead of a roll), gain an additional skill, or gain a talent.
        ▪ To make talents feel more impactful, the game could incorporate mini-quests or challenges to "unlock" certain talents, reflecting the GM's suggestion of finding a trainer or learning an ancient ritual.
• Combat System:
    ◦ Initiative:
        ▪ Detail: Combat would be turn-based. Initiative could be determined by "common sense" (game scripting, e.g., ambushers act first) or by a die roll for each side. An optional rule to add a +2 bonus to the initiative roll for characters with the Awareness skill could also be implemented.
    ◦ Attack & Damage Rolls:
        ▪ Detail: Attack rolls function as attribute checks against the target's Defense stat. The system would automatically apply the "exploding die" rule if the attacking character has the appropriate skill.
        ▪ Damage is determined by the weapon used (e.g., Dagger 1d6-2, Sword 1d6, Crossbow 1d6+3, Dragon Rifle 2d6). Damage rolls are always subject to the "exploding die" rule.
        ▪ Damage reduces Hit Points (HP). If HP drops to 0, the character is dead or dying.
    ◦ Defense & HP:
        ▪ Detail: Initial HP is calculated as 6 + Warrior attribute.
        ▪ Fate is equal to the Rogue attribute (with a minimum of 1 fate point even if Rogue is 0).
        ▪ Mana is two times the Mage attribute.
        ▪ The Defense stat is half the sum of Warrior and Rogue attributes (rounded down) plus 4.
        ▪ Worn armor and shields grant a bonus to Defense but raise the mana cost of spells by their Armor Penalty (AP).
        ▪ An optional "seriously wounded" state could be implemented for characters below half HP, imposing a -3 modifier on all attribute checks.
    ◦ Healing:
        ▪ Detail: Characters heal HP equal to their highest attribute per day of rest (allowing only light activities). The Herbalism skill would allow for an extra 2 HP healed per day.
    ◦ Hazard Damage:
        ▪ Detail: Implement environmental damage from hazards like falls (1d6 per 3 yards), suffocation/drowning (1d6 per round), poisons (mild or lethal, requiring Warrior checks), and fire (1d6 per round).
• Magic System:
    ◦ Spell Access & Casting:
        ▪ Detail: Characters with a Mage attribute of 1 or higher have access to spells. Spells must first be learned (found, bought, or transcribed) and added to a character's "personal spell book".
        ▪ Casting involves a roll against the spell's Difficulty Level (DL), consuming Mana upon success. The Thaumaturgy skill is helpful for casters. Spells generally have a line of sight range unless specified.
    ◦ Spell Circles & Enhancements:
        ▪ Detail: Spells are divided into four circles of increasing potency, with defined Mana costs and DLs (1st circle: 1 Mana, DL 5; 4th circle: 8 Mana, DL 13).
        ▪ Wearing armor adds its Armor Penalty (AP) to the mana cost of spells.
        ▪ Players can enhance spells for greater effects, which costs half the initial mana cost (rounded up) and raises the spell’s casting DL by one. Implement a system for tracking sustained spells, applying a -1 penalty to other actions, and consuming mana per duration.
        ▪ Include specific spells as examples, such as Frostburn, Healing Hand, Magic Light, Sense Magic, Telekinesis, Create Food and Water, Identify, Levitation, Lightning Bolt, Magic Armor, Chain Lightning, Air Walk, Firebolt, Enchant Weapon, Stasis, Summon Earth Elemental, Magic Step, Use Moongate, Return Life, Phantom Steed.
    ◦ Mana Regeneration:
        ▪ Detail: A character's mana pool fully refreshes after a good night's sleep. An hour's meditation will refresh mana equal to the character's Mage attribute. Magic potions can also regenerate mana.
    ◦ Magic Implements:
        ▪ Detail: Implement a system for magic implements (staves, gauntlets, rings, amulets). These items store spells and their own mana pool, which can be used to cast spells without spending personal mana. Implements grant a Thaumaturgy bonus equal to their level and can hold 10 mana per level.
        ▪ Charging implements is expensive, requiring the caster to spend two personal mana for each point stored. Implements can store a total number of spell circles up to their level.
    ◦ Ritual Magic:
        ▪ Detail: For higher-circle spells, allow players to perform ritual magic. This system would enable mana pooling from multiple participants. The Blood Mage talent could allow participants to convert HP to Mana for the ritual.
        ▪ Implement a time-based DL reduction system for rituals, where spending minimum time reduces DL by 1, and double the time reduces DL by 2, and so on.
    ◦ Optional Low-Magic Rules:
        ▪ Detail: Offer a "low-magic" game mode. This could involve replacing the Mage attribute with "Scholar" (a cosmetic change) and requiring the "Spellcaster" and "Advanced Spellcaster" talents to gain access to spells, effectively making magic rarer.
Phase 2: World, Content & Narrative Design
This phase focuses on populating the game with the world, characters, items, and stories, while maintaining WR&M's emphasis on player agency and a flexible setting.
• Vaneria Setting Implementation:
    ◦ World Map & Key Locations:
        ▪ Detail: Translate the "Fallen Imperium of Vaneria" into a detailed, explorable game world.
        ▪ Include key locations like the ruined capital of Tukrael, overrun by the undead.
        ▪ Represent distinct city-states such as:
            • Vaikus, a civilized nation with a strong caste system and Falcon Knights wielding dragon pistols.
            • Joakalavi, a bustling trade city in the Central Desert, protected by the Scorpion Guard.
            • Traevar, home to the Dark Spire, the last remaining magical academy.
            • Cemimus, a rival kingdom known for mercenary armies and corruption, currently at war with Bekel.
            • Bekel, known for ore deposits and skilled engineers and blacksmiths.
            • Chaetril, a grassland city-state exporting livestock and horses, seat of the Imperial Faith Patriarch and Paladins.
    ◦ Lore & History:
        ▪ Detail: Integrate the rich backstory of the fallen Imperium, including hints of powerful artifacts, lost technologies, and war golems. The game should encourage players to "fill in the blanks" and experience this "sandbox" world.
• NPC and Monster Bestiary:
    ◦ Detail: Implement all sample NPCs with their described attributes, skills/attacks, and "trappings" (equipment). This includes: Apprentice Mage, Bandit, Commoner, Cutthroat, Journeyman Mage, Knight, Priest, Soldier, Town Guard.
    ◦ Populate the world with various creatures and monsters from the bestiary, such as Bear, Birds of Prey, Cats, Dog, Fire Beetle, Giant Beetle, Giant Leech, Giant Rat, Giant Spider, Horse, Venomous Snake, Wolf, Dire Wolf, Drake, Fire Drake, Earth Elemental, War Golem, Work Golem, Skeleton, Zombie. Ensure their unique attacks (e.g., Fire spray, Venomous bite, Steel fist, Infected bite) and special notes (e.g., thick fur, chitin armor, ignoring half damage for skeletons, zombies arising from bites) are correctly implemented.
    ◦ The system should also allow for the generation of non-human NPCs (e.g., Orcish Bandit, Elfish Mage) by applying racial talents from Appendix 2 to human NPC stat blocks.
• Equipment & Items:
    ◦ Inventory System:
        ▪ Detail: Create a comprehensive inventory system. Include all listed weapons with their specific damage, range, cost, and notes (e.g., crossbow reload time, two-handed weapon damage).
        ▪ Implement various armor types (Clothes, Padded cloth, Leather, Scale, Lamellar, Chain mail, Light/Heavy plate, Golem armor, shields) with their Defense bonus, Armor Penalty, and cost. Special rules for Golem armor (no spell casting, damage bonus), Plate armor (fitting penalty), and Warmage Armor (0 AP) must be integrated.
        ▪ Feature unique magic items like Healing/Mana Potions, Gauntlets of Titanic Strength, Feathered Cloak, and the Rune Blade (which ignores armor).
        ▪ Include all general equipment such as Adventurer's Kits, Backpacks, various provisions, lanterns, lockpicks, clothing, vehicles, tools, and specific items for magic users (Spellbooks, Magic Implements, Spell scrolls).
• Quest & Narrative Structure:
    ◦ Detail: The game's narrative design should follow the principle of "start slow but then go epic".
    ◦ Quests should be designed to be non-linear and player-driven, offering choices that impact the game world, reflecting the tabletop's flexibility and the GM's ability to adapt.
    ◦ The narratives should build towards "epic adventures in a fantasy world filled with conflict, monsters and wondrous magic", featuring powerful artifacts, lost technologies, and ruined cities.
    ◦ The game should prioritize "GM rulings instead of rules" by designing scenarios where player choices and actions are clearly resolved by the game system, rather than forcing players to consult an in-game "rulebook" or halt gameplay for complex rule interpretation.
• "GM Fiat" and Player Agency Mechanisms:
    ◦ Detail:
        ▪ Implement the Fate point system, allowing players to spend Fate for rerolls, to ignore fatal attacks, or to change minor details in the game world (e.g., knowing an NPC, finding a needed shop item). The game system would act as the "GM" by approving these changes.
        ▪ The system should also reward players with Fate points for heroic actions, good role-playing, and achieving character goals.
        ▪ Design systems for dynamic events or procedural content generation that simulate the GM adding "new lands" or "new monsters", ensuring the world feels alive and reactive to player actions.
Phase 3: User Interface, Audio-Visual & Post-Launch Support
This final phase focuses on the player experience, presentation, and the long-term viability and community engagement for the game.
• User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX):
    ◦ Detail: Develop a clean, intuitive UI that reinforces the "simple" and "lightweight" feel of WR&M. The interface should easily allow players to manage their character's three attributes, skills, talents, HP, Mana, Fate, and Defense. Clear displays for inventory, spell books, quest logs, and combat information are essential.
• Audio-Visual Design:
    ◦ Detail: Choose an art style that evokes the "world of Vaneria", complementing the fantasy setting of the fallen Imperium. Incorporate music and sound effects to "set the mood" and enhance player immersion, as suggested for tabletop play.
• Modding Tools & Community Features:
    ◦ Detail: Crucially, to honor the "make it your own" philosophy and the Creative Commons license, the project should release official modding tools. These tools would empower players to create their own content, from new items and spells to entire campaigns and rule variations.
    ◦ Establish a community hub, such as official forums or a platform akin to the original game's "#rpmn IRC channel", where players can share their creations, discuss the game, and provide feedback. This would foster the collaborative and creative spirit of the tabletop game.
• Quality Assurance & Playtesting:
    ◦ Detail: Conduct extensive internal QA and external playtesting, potentially through an early access program. This is vital to ensure the game is balanced, enjoyable, and free of bugs, especially given the "rules-light" nature that invites diverse interpretations and potential exploits if not carefully managed. Community feedback during playtesting would be invaluable in refining the game mechanics and content.
